00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.540
Hi everyone, I'm jin jiewan. 

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.540
I will demonstrate how to interact with my movie recommendation system and the 4 options that can be chosen from. 

3
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:25.990
As you can see the movie first, welcome us and it will ask us some questions that it will according to the questions to recommend movies from the top 250 movies. 

4
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.150
And firstly, let's answer the questions on the screen. 

5
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.990
Let's say we want a new movie, not an old one. 

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.550
So we answer questions. 

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.240
Just one, but one.

8
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:57.190
And now the system has a series of recommendation movies and will choose from the 2 options to have check to choose which mode we will. 

9
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.670
Like to check the movies. 

10
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:07.840
Let's say we just want the simple mode, so it just shows us the titles of the movies that is recommended, which are 2 movies. 

11
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.020
Let's say we want to check the plot of the movies from the next 2 options, so we enter one. 

12
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.720
And we will check the first movie, the movie one which is up. 

13
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.790
So we still enter one and it shows that the plot of the movie up. 

14
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.390
That is a 78 years old Carl, blah, blah, blah. 

15
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.890
And then if we want to check the link of the movies, we will enter 2. 

16
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.610
And we enter one to check the link of the movie up. 

17
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.590
So it direct us to the website of the movie from the IMDB website. 

18
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.740
And we can see more details on the website. 

19
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.440
And then we return to our program. 

20
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.700
Let's say we don't want more information, so we. 

21
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.660
And exit. 

22
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.800
And we. 

23
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
I will play it again to review the process. 

24
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520
And then I will answer questions very quick.

25
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.420
And this time I will check the first option. 

26
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.980
That is the detailed mood. 

27
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:35.520
So it gives us many details about the movies, such as ranking the genres, year it release, the director and the run time. 

28
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.400
I will see the link of the movies, so I enter to. 

29
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.720
And I will check the link of the godfather part 2. 

30
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.520
So I enter 2 for the second movie. 

31
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.680
So we can see the link website of the movie as expected and an exit system. 

32
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.200
So that's my demonstration of my program. 

33
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.080
Hope you will like it and hope you will have a great winter break. 

34
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.490
Bye.
