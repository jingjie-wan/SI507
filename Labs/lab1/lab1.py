1. Write a function named CelsiusToFarenheit
   your function should ask the user for a temperature in celsius
   your function should convert the temperature to farenheit
   your function should print the Farenheit Temperature (no return statement)
   The formula for conversion is (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
   Check your answer 0°C should be 32°F and 100°C should be 212°F

# 2. Write a function named MarketingCampaign.
#    your function should accept the following parameters:
#        DigitalAds - an integer representing the budget for buying internet ads
#        TVAds - an integer representing the budget for buying television ads
#        PrintAds - an integer representing the budget for buying newspaper ads

#    Calculation: Assume that at your company a single marketing campaign consists of
#             7 digital ads (cost: 1 unit per ad = 7 units)
#             3 television ads (cost: 1 unit per ad = 3 units)
#             6 print ads. (cost: 1 unit per ad = 6 units)
#             and that ads of all types cost 1 unit.

#     Return Value:
#        An integer representing the number of full marketing campaigns you can run


#    Hint: There is a built-in python function called min() that may be useful
#    Hint2: You can solve this without conditionals.
#    Self-check your function if you have budget of 400 for digital, 22 for TV and 125 for print your output should be 7

# 2B. Make a second function that also asks the user to input the current prices for the three
# types of ads before calculating the number of marketing campaigns that can be run at the new
# prices.

# NOTE: a single marketing campaign still consists of:
#     7 digital ads (cost per add to be input by user)
#     3 television ads (cost per add to be input by user)
#     6 print ads (cost per add to be input by user)
